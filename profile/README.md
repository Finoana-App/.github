## Our Vision

In a world overflowing with noise and algorithms, **Finoana** aims to build a space centered on **faith**, a place where believers can **connect, pray together, encourage one another, and grow spiritually** without the digital clutter.

## Core Features

* **Community Spaces**: discussions, thematic groups (youth, couples, worship, intercession…), online prayer rooms.
* **Prayer Journal**: personal or shared, with optional anonymity.
* **Wall of Blessings**: testimonies, encouragements, and reactions (“Amen”, “Praying with you”).
* **Verified Resources**: videos, podcasts, shared PDF materials.
* **Events**: conferences, online services, group fasts, local gatherings map.
* **Anonymous Encouragements**: send a random Bible verse to another member.
* **Safety & Respect**: human moderation, ad-free environment, and faith-based kindness.
